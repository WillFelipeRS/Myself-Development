# Myself-Development
Here I will post my projects carried out during the Data Science Degree at Let's Code, in order to show you my development and how I apply the teachings I have been learning.

Projeto 1 was the first project I've worked. It is a Hangman Game - with just portuguese words only - very fun and just a little bit hard. Remember you must download the archive 'bancoPalavras.txt' and save it at the same file you saved the main archive.

Projeto 2 is a tricky Tic-Tac-Toe game: run it and try to win. <Spoiler>: you will not.

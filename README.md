# My personal development
Here I present some small projects that I did along my path as a beginner programmer. I'm taking classes at EBAC - Escola Brit√¢nica de Artes Criativas & Tecnologia, Back-End Python course. So here will be posted some projects I've done as a portfolio to show what I've learned, in addition to other projects I've done as a personal challenge.

Projeto 1 was the first project I've worked. It is a Hangman Game - with just portuguese words only - very fun and just a little bit hard. Remember you must download the archive 'bancoPalavras.txt' and save it at the same file you saved the main archive.

Projeto 2 is a tricky Tic-Tac-Toe game: run it and try to win. Spoiler: you will not.

Projeto 5 is about data visualization. Using Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Plotly, the objective of this project is to demonstrate the required information in clear and understandable graphics.
